# A Message From tgolpa:

*Having worked in a slew of fields and having accumulated sufficient human capital through which to perform at a top tier skill level; I believe my past work experience and my talents can be of use to my next career path. I’m currently working at a Law Firm where we negotiate and implement solutions daily. Having long held a love for technology, I now seek to learn the necessary skills to pursue the career I’ve dreamt of. For a large duration of my life I was overweight, however through my own research and drive; I found a love of fitness and wellness, adapting my diet and exercise to lose 90lbs in about 6 months – I want to apply this drive and passion I’ve developed to my work place, the people I encounter & toward furthering myself within my career.*

*The following are hopes I have for coding:*

## iOS
## Web Frontend
## Backend

- *The following represent what I currently hope to improve in:*

1. [ ] **Mobile App Design**
2. [x] **Web Design**
3. [ ] **Programming**
