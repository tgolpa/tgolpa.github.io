# A Message From tgolpa:

*Having worked in a slew of fields and having accumulated sufficient human capital through which to perform at a top tier skill level; I believe my past work experience and my talents can be of use to my next career path. I’m currently working at a Law Firm where we negotiate and implement solutions daily. Having long held a love for technology, I now seek to learn the necessary skills to pursue the career I’ve dreamt of. For a large duration of my life I was overweight, however through my own research and drive; I found a love of fitness and wellness, adapting my diet and exercise to lose 90lbs in about 6 months – I want to apply this drive and passion I’ve developed to my work place, the people I encounter & toward furthering myself within my career.*

*The following are goals I have for coding:*

## iOS
## Web Frontend
## Backend

- *The following represent what I currently hope to improve in:*

1. [ ] **Mobile App Design**
2. [x] **Web Design**
3. [ ] **Programming**

~ A branch is a clone of the master/main project worked on in git, used to edit or work on code without effecting the primary project branch until ready to merge/pull request. A commit it an edit or change made to the branch, and such can be seen in the history of a project branch. To rebase the pull request on master and squash it into one commit so it can be merged & reduce the number of commits to clean the branch history; it means to perform a pull request and then squash commits to reduce the number of comments & changes listed so the branches when merged and allow for a more streamlined view of edits and progress made.
